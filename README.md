# Game Development Pathways
## 1. Game Programming
Game programmers are software engineers that write various codes for video games. This allows for the game to actually function and it brings all the other visual and audible aspects of the game to life.
## 2. Game Design
Game designers are responsible for actually designing the game itself. They create the core vision of the game and design the core rules and mechanics.
## 3. Game Art
Game artists are responsible for creating the visual art of the game. This can be the 3D models and maps or the 2D pictures depending on what kind of game is being developed.
## 4. Audio Design
Audio designers create all the audio for the game. This can be music heard in the background, boss fight music, credit music, or even just sound effects.
## 5. Narrative Design
Narrative designers are the story tellers. They write immersive stories and create the plot for the game.
# Game programming disciplines
## 1. AI
AI is used in game programming to create immersive features such as intelligrant NPC's, or "non-player characters". Artificial Intelligence Programmers are often in charge of coding these features.
## 2. Physics
Physics is important in games for developing realistic and immersive gameplay. Physics Programmers are responsible for scripting models that implament real-life or custom physics depending on the game.
## 3. Graphics
Video games often gave Graphic Programmers that are in charge of managing the visual effects of the game. They cretae scripts that will render 2D or 3D graphics, managing assets, and optimizing graphics in general
## 4. Gameplay
Gameplay programmers create the scripts for the general gameplay. They script the game rules and mechanics and translate designs into an interactive feature of the game.
## 5. Engine
Engines are extremely important for any game development team. Game engines are what helps to piece things together and make the game run. Engine Programmers develop engines for the game to run on that include all the required aspects of the game that are necessary.

# Awesome-GameDev-Repo

This is my first repository. I will be discussing a list of 10 tools that are important to game development.

## 1. Game engines
Game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine are important for developing games. They allow for the general development of the game and for the games to actually run.
## 2. 3D and 2D art tools
Depending on what kind of game you are creating will determine whether you use 3D, 2D or both. They will be an essential tool for the visual aspect of the games.
Some examples may be Blender, photoshop or just art programs such as Krita.
## 3. Sound design and Music programs/tools.
Sound effects and music helps bring games to life and is an extremely important tool for creating dynamic games. 
## 4. Programming softwares
Programming softwares such as Visual Studio are extremely important for creating the main functions of the game. It is what makes the game interactable and turns the sound and images into an actual playable game.
## 5. Project and communication management
Apps like Discord and GitHub are important for game development. Games are often created by groups of people that are working together with different skills and piecing everything together. Being able to communicate and cooperate with your team is essential for efficiently putting all the seperate pieces of the game together.

# Game Development Pathways
## 1. Game Programming
Game programmers are software engineers that write various codes for video games. This allows for the game to actually function and it brings all the other visual and audible aspects of the game to life.
## 2. Game Design
Game designers are responsible for actually designing the game itself. They create the core vision of the game and design the core rules and mechanics.
## 3. Game Art
Game artists are responsible for creating the visual art of the game. This can be the 3D models and maps or the 2D pictures depending on what kind of game is being developed.
## 4. Audio Design
Audio designers create all the audio for the game. This can be music heard in the background, boss fight music, credit music, or even just sound effects.
## 5. Narrative Design
Narrative designers are the story tellers. They write immersive stories and create the plot for the game.
